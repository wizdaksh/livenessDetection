# Liveness Detection

A computer vision system to detect real human presence and prevent spoofing attacks using photos, videos, and deepfakes.

---

## Overview

This project implements **liveness detection** techniques to distinguish between real faces and spoofed ones, such as:

- Printed photographs
- Video replays
- Deepfake manipulations

It's designed to enhance security in face authentication systems.

---

## Methods Used

- **Optical Flow** â€“ Tracks motion to detect inconsistencies in fake media.
- **DLib Blink Detection** â€“ Identifies natural blinking patterns as a sign of life.
- **68 Face Landmarks** - Returns x,y coordinates for facial landmarks
